# Windows host

A small .NET Framework `.scr` host launches Microsoft Edge to render `/display`.
`windows/Build-Host.ps1` uses the Windows Framework compiler; no SDK, native
package, administrator installation or always-running idle watcher is required.

## Entry points and lifetime

- `/s` or `--display`: ensure the installed backend is owned/ready, capture one
  last-desktop thumbnail if enabled, then launch the isolated Edge kiosk.
- `/c` (also `/c:<handle>`) or no argument: start the backend and open `/editor`.
- `/p <parent HWND>` (also `/p:<handle>`): draw a dim, capture-free placeholder
  in the Windows screensaver preview; no Edge/backend is launched.
- `--check`: verify Edge can be found; no display or capture.
- `--test-display`: display with automatic dismissal after eight seconds, for
  bounded integration verification. Capture still follows the preview setting.

The helper observes input to dismiss an active display, not to decide when to
activate. A 1.2-second launch grace prevents the activation key from dismissing
it. A per-user mutex prevents simultaneous ambient sessions. Session lock,
logoff and disconnect close the display. A named event scoped to the installed
helper path lets `Stop` ask it to exit normally.

Edge starts suspended, is assigned to an owned Windows job, then resumes. The
job uses `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`, so dismissal and helper crashes
terminate only that browser process tree. No global Edge/node kill, window input
injection, audio change or media key is used. The backend lives independently.
Scripts validate PID, executable path, command line and process start time before
stopping it. Source runs and other apps are not adopted.

## Preview and privacy

The helper captures the primary display once with `CopyFromScreen`, before any
ambient browser exists. It scales to at most 640 by 360, encodes PNG into a
`MemoryStream`, uploads to loopback, and disposes pixel buffers. No screenshot
file, history, capture log or image export is implemented. DPI awareness makes
bounds physical pixels. This is last state, not live capture.

A memory-only token obtained through `/api/host/session` authenticates upload and
delete; browser-origin requests cannot retrieve it. Preview responses use
no-store. Tokens/pixels never enter settings, reminders, backup or diagnostics.
Dismissal calls DELETE; server age expiry, preview disable and process exit also
clear pixels. If the host is forcibly killed, server expiry bounds retention;
stopping the server clears RAM.

The snapshot may contain anything visible on the primary desktop. Minimized apps
are not captured separately. Protected content may be black/unavailable; failed
capture omits preview. No elevated access, protection bypass or locked-desktop
capture is attempted. Capture precedes display creation to avoid recursive
previews. Multi-monitor selection and live capture are not built.

## Idle and security

Native Windows screensaver activation is preferred over a blind idle timer:
media/game apps can inhibit the system screensaver. No background service,
scheduled task, startup entry or global input hook is installed. `EnableIdle`
saves the previous per-user screensaver/timeout and selects this app;
`DisableIdle`/uninstall restore it when this app remains selected. Lock-on-resume
is never edited. Managed policy is not overridden. This is a visual screensaver,
not a lock-screen replacement.

Not every player/game necessarily inhibits screensavers. Test the actual apps,
including fullscreen video, controller-only games, presentations and lock/resume.
Keep automatic activation off until those tests pass. A manual smoke test cannot
establish them.

## Verification

Observed 2026-10-18: Windows 10 Pro 10.0.19045 x64, existing Edge, Framework
v4.0.30319 compiler, PowerShell 7 and Windows PowerShell 5.1. Helper compilation,
`--check` and invalid-parent preview exit were exercised. The control script
parses under both PowerShell engines.

Pending: official-runtime installation, server lifecycle, kiosk/snapshot/clear,
update/data/uninstall, clean-account install, media/game inhibition, secure
lock/resume and multi-monitor behavior. Automatic activation stays off during QA.
